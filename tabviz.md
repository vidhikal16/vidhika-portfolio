## Step two: critique the data visualization

Here is a part of google form which highlights my observation:

Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?   *

The data visualization that I picked demonstrates that the yearly wage of police officers ($70,446) is more than the average national salary of $55,523. The overall representation looks good and below are my detailed thoughts:

What I liked:
-The minimalistic diagram has no unnecessary elements 
-The bar chart chosen looks good highlighting the police officers bar which is the focus of the chart 
-The color chosen looks fine, highlighting the police officer bar and other bars in gray.
-The x-axis label looks good, and the instances of the values is acceptable. 
-The occupation is written on the bar

What I didn’t like:
-I think the visualization lags behind in communicating the information: I didn’t understand from the visualization why the police officer bar was highlighted differently.
-It didn’t mark the average salary point, which again fails to communicate the important information. 
-The visualization also fails to tell why that information is important for us to know, what exactly it is trying to convey with the fact that police officer’s average salary is more than the national average salary. That piece of information is also missing from the context provided. 

What I would do differently:
-I would mark the national average salary point. 
-I would put a title that explains the visualization like “occupations whose salaries are more than national average salary” 
-I would highlight only the part after the national average salary, showing how much more it is than the national average salary.
Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? *

The primary audience for this visualization is the police department, where they want to understand if the industry of police administration is paid well. This visualization does justice by providing the necessary information that it is more than the national average salary (which can be read from the context description, not from the visualization). If the visualization is refined, it will serve its purpose better. 
Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *

I think this approach worked fine, it made us think about the visualization from different angles and in different ways, criteria, which made us realize the aspects to look after when we are creating the visualizations. 
My recommendation is around the information display:
-Give a title that summarizes the intention behind the visualization
-Highlight the national average salary


## Step three: wireframe a solution





## Step five: Build your solution
