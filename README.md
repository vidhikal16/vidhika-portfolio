Hi! This is my first portfolio. :)


## About me
Hi! My name is Vidhika Lonare (she/her). I'm a second year student in Information Systems Management program. This is my final semester, hope to learn as much as I can. I love to discuss about products and Technology!  

Also, I like to go out, take a walk, ride a bus before I begin my class - so not enjoying the online classes. But the course looks inetersting, looking forward to it! 

## Learnings
The top 5 learnings through the course "Telling Stories with Data" by Christopher Goranson <cgoranso@andrew.cmu.edu> were:
1. How to effectively tell a story using data visualizations
2. Use of the platforms - Flourish, Tableau, Storyboard, etc
3. Smart way of using colors for data visualizations 
4. The art of persuasion through data visualizations
5. The art of critiquing data visualizations
