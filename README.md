Hi! This is my first portfolio. :)


## About me
Hi! My name is Vidhika Lonare (she/her). I'm a second year student in Information Systems Management program. This is my final semester, hope to learn as much as I can. I love to discuss about products and Technology!  

Also, I like to go out, take a walk, ride a bus before I begin my class - so not enjoying the online classes. But the course looks inetersting, looking forward to it! 

## What I hope to learn
Get handy with data visualization.
