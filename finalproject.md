## Outline 

### Summary 

The final project will focus on showing how social connections directly affect our well-being and health and is instrumental to prosperity and material well-being. Loneliness is associated with the shortening of the life span. In order to achieve better outcomes, people should believe in socializing more than now. 

### Project Structure 

The high-level structure of the project:
1. Start - data showing the relationship between socializing with mental well-being - showing that the more social connections better it is for mental well-being. 
2. The cross-sectional correlation between happiness and friends
3. How it looked like over the years - earlier there were more social connections and people were happier 
4. Causes and the implications -
5. Call to Action - What should be one ideally doing to avoid these implications
6. Other positive aspects of social networks to human beings
7. End - Resources and links to read more about it

As a reader, I should be taking social networks seriously to achieve well-being
I can do this by socializing more and look forward to meeting friends and family more frequently.
