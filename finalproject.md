# Part-1 Final Project

## Outline 

### Summary 

The final project will focus on showing how social connections directly affect our well-being and health and is instrumental to prosperity and material well-being. Loneliness is associated with the shortening of the life span. In order to achieve better outcomes, people should believe in socializing more than now. 

### Project Structure 

The high-level structure of the project:
1. Start - data showing the relationship between socializing with mental well-being - showing that the more social connections better it is for mental well-being. 
2. The cross-sectional correlation between happiness and friends
3. How it looked like over the years - earlier there were more social connections and people were happier 
4. Causes and the implications -
5. Call to Action - What should be one ideally doing to avoid these implications
6. Other positive aspects of social networks to human beings
7. End - Resources and links to read more about it

As a reader, I should be taking social networks seriously to achieve well-being
I can do this by socializing more and look forward to meeting friends and family more frequently. 

## Sketches 

1. The project opens up with the data showing that those who socialize more tend to be happier

2. It shows more data on the correlation between friends and happiness - to strengthen the argument

3. Data showing how we ignored the fact that socializing helps in mental well-being and because of that, happiness has decreased over the years

4. Other associations with social connections - other positive outcomes

## Data

The primary source of the data for my project is Our World in Data: -[Link here](https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness#causality-and-implications)

There are many datasets available on other sites including Our World in Data. The relevant datasets that I have found till now are uploaded in my Github Repository. 
I will be refinine the visualizations and convey the key information which align with my project. The links to those repositories: 

1. -[One Person Households](https://github.com/vidhikal16/vidhika-portfolio/blob/f9522531de564871cb61137594e89f4a34410cb1/one-person-households.csv)
2. -[Productivity per hour](https://github.com/vidhikal16/vidhika-portfolio/blob/43321856a39ea781e719a70b118e9ad69f74222d/labor-productivity-per-hour-PennWorldTable.csv)
3. -[Proportion of unemployed](https://github.com/vidhikal16/vidhika-portfolio/blob/43321856a39ea781e719a70b118e9ad69f74222d/proportion-of-unemployed-using-specific-search-methods.csv)
4. -[Self Reported Loneliness](https://github.com/vidhikal16/vidhika-portfolio/blob/43321856a39ea781e719a70b118e9ad69f74222d/self-reported-loneliness-older-adults.csv)

These are some of the datasets, which I will be using to build visualizations which depicts: 
1. Number of lonely adults
2. How material well-being is related with the socialization 
3. Productivity associated with happiness
4. Numer of people living alone is increasing over the years - people live alone more these days

In addition to these data sets, I am going to find more similar data which is going to help me strengthen the argument.

## Method and Medium

The platform I plan on presenting my project is shorthand. I belive it will make the story coherent and will be able to communicate the story succinctly. 

The approach for my project would be:
1. Refine the story line: Will put together my ideas once again to see if the reader will be able to connect the dots and make any changes necessary. 
2. Find more data: I will try and find more datasets through which I will be able create visualizations which conveys the important information. 
3. Build visualization: I will create the visualization using tableau as I feel it gives more flexibity and options.
4. Ask for feedback: I will ask around my friends to see if the story looks compelling and interesting, and if that makes them learn more about it. 
5. Improve as I receive the feedback: Based on the feedback I receive, I will make the changes. 
6. Citations: During the whole process, I will make sure to put the citations at place.
