## Part 1

When I reflect back to the journey of the final project, I understand the importance of Part 1 where I had to develop the structure of the project, find datasets for visualization and developing the rough sketches. It helped me put the structure together and understand which data would be required for my topic. I found some good data - relationship between friends and happiness, productivity per hour impact on the GDP of the country. 

Target Audience: I had a broad target audience in the Part 1 - the general public, which I planned to narrow down to students and young professionals moving forward. This let me find some facts which were precisely relevant to the audience. 

Call to Action: The call to action was also pretty general for the broader audience. I put the call to action as to learn about the topic and engage in social activities which I later understood is not interesting enough for the audience to actually take the action. 

## Part 2

In part 2, I made a significant improvement wherein I was able to create the storyboard using Shorthand. It was fun to actually starting putting everything together to build a story around the topic. I used the resources in: 
a. collecting facts and data
b. built visualization on the datasets 
c. building the storyline - understanding which information is important for the topic 

### User Interview
I interviewed 3 candidates which was pretty helpful in understanding if I had interesting and fresh information in the story, and if the audience is feeling engaged and encouraged enough to take call to action. I also researched on the design if there is any hinderance in understanding the story - the color, font and titles, etc.  

With the interviews I got one interesting feedback about including the social media aspect to tha narrative as social connections are built today mostly through social media. Although, I initally thought that would be a good thing to add, but ultimately I decided not to include it because the main purpose of this topic was to encourage people go out of home and actually get enagaged with people physically. 

Ultimately, I had included visualizations from different sources, videos and included some data facts to support the intention behind the story - to motivate towards socializing. Initially, the story was going in multiple directions - taking into consideration the different age ranges, having multiple data repositories which were esentially not good enough to put the story together. I also had to build more visualizations of my own, and discard the placeholders. Moving forward, I had found some relevant data sources, but the visualization of happiness and friends which I thought to be important, I couldn't find dataset for that. 

Other minor details including the theme, the main page title were to be improved upon in the Part 3. 

## Part 3
The biggest change from Part 2 was adding visualizations. Since I did not get to get enough feedback on visualizations during the Part 2, I decided to ask a few of friends for the feedback on my visualizations. I got feedback on the how the focus of the visualizations should be narrowed down on highlighting the key information on the charts. I also decided to remove one of the video - productivity at work and replace it with an visualization which shows the affect of productivity on the GDP of the country. 

The additional tangent which I added was the Covid-19 perspective to the story where I wanted to emphasize about how Covid has made socializing even harder and we may have to relearn everything about social connections. Which definitely helped me to emphasize the severity of the issue, and why people should be putting more efforts than ever in addressing the cause. 

Most of the efforts on Part 3 was making the story more coherent and highlighting the key data points so as to make the story more appealing. 

### Working with Shorthand
Working with Shorthand was easy experience which gave the liberty to add photos, videos, embedded links for visualizations. It was pretty easy to drag and drop sections from the template and use them to add my content. Adding any image and video was very easy, where free images can be just added using Splash. Visualizations were also easy to add through embed code. All of these facilities made the work so much easier than other platforms. 

There were some limitations around the different font size in a same paragraph, I could not emphasize the numbers with that. It wasn't a major drawback but there were limited options to play around with the text and numbers. 

### Target Audience 
Finally, I decided to focus more on the audience of students and young professionals. Although, the important information remained the same regarding the mental and physical health. I decided to put the targetted information more on the Call to Action, where I would call out more on that audience and resources for them to check. I had suggestions around expanding the audience and adding different age group people as audience but that was difficult to incorporate and suggest them call to action. 

Overall, it was a fun experience working on something very first time on building the visualizations on my own and using it to tell a story to the audience. The overall flow of finding the argument, understanding it, finding the right audience and them building a narrative to put across your thought. I got to understand the embedding of visualizations in a platform like Shorthand. I also got an idea about how useful and effective way it is use to visualizations to tell a story. 

### Further Improvement
To improve this story further, I would put more efforts on the following areas:
1. Focused and curated information on more narrowed down audience by presenting more visualizations focused on the audience 
2. Improve on the call to action - add more resources 
3. Make the visuals and color coding more consistent
