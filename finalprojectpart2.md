## User Research and Interviews 

a. The target audience:
The target audience that I have identified are young people of age 20-35 years. They can be student or young professionals.

b. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:
For my user research, I plan to interview 3 of my friends whose characteristics are as follows:
1. Female, 27 years, Student, USA: Doing her Master's after 3 years of work experience 
2. Female, 24 years, Student, USA: Doing her Master's right after undergrad
3. Male, 28 years, Working Professional, USA: Working after completing Master's degree

I chose to interview a mix of users where I will be able to get reviews from someone who has had work experience and is a student, who is working right now and had been a student and someone who is a student and doesn't have work experience at all. 

In this way, I hope to achieve the following things:
1. I will be able to understand if they the storyline and data I have put is relatable to both type of audience.
2. Should I cater information more towards a single type of audience?
3. Is the data visualization sufficient to pursue them? 
4. Do they find any new information?
5. Is the storyboard engaging enough?

c. Interview script:
Hello thank you for meeting with me today. I am working on a project and I want to get feedback from you. I am not testing your understanding, I want to test my storyline, visuals and overall board to help me refine it. 

I want you to check the storyboard first and then I would ask you 6 questions. At any point you can say you have no inputs for a particular question.

Question 1 - What did you hope to see in the storyboard after looking at the title slide?
Question 2 - Is there any new information you found through the storyboard?
Question 3 - Do you think the board has relevant informatiom for you?
Question 4 - How you feel about data visualizations provided here?
Question 5 - What other information would you like to see? 
Question 6 - Do you feel like taking the actions mentioned in the storyboard?

d. Findings from the interviews:

e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
