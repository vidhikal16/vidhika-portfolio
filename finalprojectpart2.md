## Storyboard

I have created the storyboard using Shorthand. Here's the link:

## User Research and Interviews 

a. The target audience:
The target audience that I have identified are young people of age 20-35 years. They can be student or young professionals.

b. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:
For my user research, I plan to interview 3 of my friends whose characteristics are as follows:
1. Interviewee 1: Female, 27 years, Student, USA: Doing her Master's after 3 years of work experience 
2. Interviewee 2: Female, 24 years, Student, USA: Doing her Master's right after undergrad
3. Interviewee 3: Male, 28 years, Working Professional, USA: Working after completing Master's degree

I chose to interview a mix of users where I will be able to get reviews from someone who has had work experience and is a student, who is working right now and had been a student and someone who is a student and doesn't have work experience at all. 

In this way, I hope to achieve the following things:
1. I will be able to understand if they the storyline and data I have put is relatable to both type of audience.
2. Should I cater information more towards a single type of audience?
3. Is the data visualization sufficient to pursue them? 
4. Do they find any new information?
5. Is the storyboard engaging enough?

c. Interview script:
Hello thank you for meeting with me today. I am working on a project and I want to get feedback from you. I am not testing your understanding, I want to test my storyline, visuals and overall board to help me refine it. 

I want you to check the storyboard first and then I would ask you 6 questions. At any point you can say you have no inputs for a particular question.

Question 1 - What did you hope to see in the storyboard after looking at the title slide?
Question 2 - Is there any new information you found through the storyboard?
Question 3 - Do you think the board has relevant informatiom for you?
Question 4 - How you feel about data visualizations provided here?
Question 5 - What other information would you like to see? 
Question 6 - Would you check videos or external links? 
Question 7 - Do you feel like taking the actions mentioned in the storyboard?

d. Findings from the interviews:

| Questions | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2 | Interviewee 3 |
| What did you hope to see in the storyboard after looking at the title slide? | How a person evolves socially? It is going to talk about health, not just professional work or money, emotionally and everything. | I felt it is about social platforms, how can we use social media to boost our healthy well-being because we can’t get rid of it.| I am hoping to see new information on how it is related to well-being.  
| Is there any new information you found through the storyboard? | West Berlin - that was something new and interesting to see there is economic impact too, did not expect it. | Some facts like loneliness is similar to 15 cigarettes. I did not know exactly which components of physical health is affected - it is new to me. I knew it implacts physical health but not what exactly.  Economic effect is new to me. | The health aspects were new to me - the exact details are interesting to see. |
| Do you think the board has relevant informatiom for you? | The physical health information - increase brain health is interesting. | Yes, definitely. Some of the information is repetitive but I would read it all later. | Yes, since I don't socialize, these facts are interesting to know | 
| How you feel about data visualizations provided here? |  Happiness and Friends - had to zoom, not placed properly. Others are good. | Are theoretical - happiness and friends - can’t read it. Can’t skim through it quickly. Important information could be highlighted. | I would like to see more visualizations, some of them are interesting, but not all like - happiness and friends, I kind of know that already |
| What other information would you like to see? | Since it should be both ways - I would like to see more - from a university perspective - would like to engage in more group assignments. | Something that promotes the use of social media for healthy well-being. How can we leverage social media to tackle this issue? | If there are more intersting facts |
| Would you check videos or external links? | I would like to check physical health video, not the other one. | I would not check the external links but would I would check out the videos later. | Yes, I like videos better than texts, I would check the physical health video and the links |
| Do you feel like taking the actions mentioned in the storyboard? | Add more information on what both employee and employers can do - give examples like there are examples for students. Young professionals - change to professionasl - just not the young ones. Also, add some of the events from the site and say for more information visit the link. | I would like to see more actions that can be taken. Some kind of wellness center. I would also like to see more for all age groups and someone who is home school. Something like coffee chat. For someone who is starting - for them coffee chat is good. Link is nice - but it was not intuitive much. | Yes, but for a professional like me, I don't see much options. | 

e. Future Changes

1. I am planning on adding the social media aspect as well to my story. This was one of the recommendations that I got from the interviewee, which makes sense to me - how social media adds to this topic because social media has become a big part of our lives; and social connections todays mostly rely on social media platforms.

2. I am planning on more data visualizations, which I will be creating using Flourish or Tableau. I couldn't add much data visualizations in Part - 2, as I thought I already had a number of pieces to put togther, to convey my story.

3. I would remove the generic information, and kind of focus more on the new information, like remove the productivity at work section, that no one found interesting. 

4. Call to action: I would also add more action items for the audience to check 
a. I will add some events happening nearby to highlight on the main page and then add link to check out more.
b. I will include broader age group professionals.
c. I will add more action items for a professional and a manager.

5. I will the page more consistent with theme and color - either dark or light. 

6. Small tweaks in Text font and color: I will make the Title Page's section bigger with bolder title.
